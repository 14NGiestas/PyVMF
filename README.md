# PyVMF
A python VMF parser

Made for Cs:Go but should work for other source games, full support coming some time soon.

This projects turns the VMF into python classes, and allows you to modify pretty much everything, from displacements to
obscure entities. This allows you to create insanely complex geometry through python code, see images below.
